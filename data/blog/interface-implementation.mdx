[Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces) are implemented implicitly in Go. Think of interfaces in Go like a rule book that says:
“If you can do these things, then you belong to this group.”

Let's visualize this with a simple example. 

## Step 1: Define an interface (The Rule book)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// ToyCar is the rule book (interface) that says a car must have Drive() and Honk()
type ToyCar interface {
    Drive()
    Honk()
}

```

## Step 2: Create a Struct 

Now, we create a struct (RemoteCar) that follows these rules. 

```go
// RemoteCar is a real toy car that can drive and honk
type RemoteCar struct{}

// RemoteCar has a Drive() method (so it follows part of the rule book)
func (r RemoteCar) Drive() {
    fmt.Println("Vroom! The car is driving!")
}

// RemoteCar has a Honk() method (so it fully follows the rule book)
func (r RemoteCar) Honk() {
    fmt.Println("Beep beep! The car is honking!")
}
```

Since `RemoteCar` has both `Drive()` and `Honk()`, it automatically belongs to the `ToyCar` group—without us saying anything!

## Step 3: Let's create a Function to Check if It Follows the Rule book

If we write a function that accepts only things that follow ToyCar, and it works with RemoteCar, that means RemoteCar follows the rules!

```go
// PlayWithToy takes anything that follows the ToyCar rules
func PlayWithToy(car ToyCar) {
    car.Drive()
    car.Honk()
}
```

## Step 4: Let's Test It

Now, let's test it inside `main()`:

```go
func main() {
    myCar := RemoteCar{} // Create a toy car
    PlayWithToy(myCar)   // Check if it follows the rules
}
```

Expected Output:

```bash
Vroom! The car is driving!
Beep beep! The car is honking!
```

### What Just Happened?

- We **never** explicitly said `RemoteCar` implements `ToyCar`, but since it has all the required methods, Go automatically considers it part of `ToyCar`.
- If we removed `Honk()` from `RemoteCar`, the program wouldn't compile, because `RemoteCar` wouldn't fully match the `ToyCar` rule book.

This is what we mean when we say “**Interfaces are implemented implicitly in Go**”—you don't have to **declare** it; if a type **matches**, it is that interface.
